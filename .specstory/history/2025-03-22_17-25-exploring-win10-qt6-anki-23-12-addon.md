Based on my examination of the codebase, here's a summary of the Anki Review Pop-Up addon:

## Anki Review Pop-Up - Addon Overview

This is an Anki addon for Windows 10 running Qt6 and Anki 23.12 that provides motivational pop-up messages when reviewing flashcards. Here's what it does:

1. **Core Functionality**: 
   - Displays pop-up messages when answering flashcards (Again, Hard, Good, Easy buttons)
   - Can also show pop-ups when pressing the Show Answer button
   - Pop-ups include customizable text, images, and audio/video

2. **Key Features**:
   - Configurable chance of showing pop-ups (0-100%)
   - Option to enable/disable pop-ups for specific answer buttons
   - Customizable header texts, fonts, and sizes
   - Support for random or ordered display of media
   - Media organized by answer type (again, hard, good, easy, show_answer)

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Written in Python using Qt for the UI
   - Uses Anki's hooks system to integrate with the review process
   - Files are organized into:
     - Core Python files (__init__.py, Review_PopUp.py, ShowAnswer_PopUp.py, Settings2.py)
     - Configuration (config.json, manifest.json)
     - User media folders (images, audio, video_gif)

4. **Architecture**:
   - `__init__.py`: Main entry point that imports the required modules
   - `Review_PopUp.py`: Handles pop-ups when answering cards
   - `ShowAnswer_PopUp.py`: Handles pop-ups when showing answers
   - `Settings2.py`: UI for configuring the addon
   - User files are organized in directories by answer type

The addon works by wrapping Anki's `_answerCard` and `_showAnswer` methods to display pop-ups based on configured settings and randomly selected media files from the appropriate directories.

Would you like me to explore any specific aspect of the addon in more detail?

_**User**_

dont code yet. the addon is good, the only thing i want improve is make the image popup full screen/maximize as much. curently even i got a very large wall paper to display. it's size is not full screen. why?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>
Let me analyze why the images aren't displaying at full screen size. Looking at the relevant code in the popup window creation, I need to check how the image sizing is handled.

From the code I've seen in `Review_PopUp.py` and `ShowAnswer_PopUp.py`, both files have similar image handling code:

```python
pixmap = QPixmap(image_folder + image_name)
max_height = min(pixmap.height(), 1024)
max_width = min(pixmap.width(), 1024)
picture = pixmap.scaled(max_width, max_height, Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio, Qt.TransformationMode.SmoothTransformation)
```

This code is limiting the image size in two ways:
1. It's capping the maximum height and width to 1024 pixels
2. It's scaling the image to maintain aspect ratio

The issue is that these hardcoded limitations (1024px) prevent the image from being truly full-screen, especially on modern high-resolution displays that can be 1920x1080 or higher.

Additionally, when the image is displayed, the window itself isn't being maximized:
```python
window.exec()
```

There's no code that explicitly sets the window to be fullscreen or maximized. 

To make the image display at full screen size, we would need to:
1. Remove the 1024px limitation
2. Get the screen size dynamically
3. Set the window to be fullscreen or maximized
4. Scale the image to fit the screen size
</think>

Looking at the issue with the images not displaying in full screen, I can see the problem in the code. Let me examine the relevant parts:

I see the issue now. When examining the code, I found where the image size is being limited in both `Review_PopUp.py` and `ShowAnswer_PopUp.py`:

```python
pixmap = QPixmap(image_folder + image_name)
max_height = min(pixmap.height(), 1024)
max_width = min(pixmap.width(), 1024)
picture = pixmap.scaled(max_width, max_height, Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio, Qt.TransformationMode.SmoothTransformation)
```

The problem is that the addon explicitly limits the image size to a maximum of 1024x1024 pixels, which is not full screen on most modern displays (which are typically 1920x1080 or higher). Additionally, the popup window itself is not set to be fullscreen or maximized.

Here are the specific issues preventing full-screen display:

1. **Hard-coded size limitation**: The code uses `max_height = min(pixmap.height(), 1024)` and `max_width = min(pixmap.width(), 1024)`, which restricts images to 1024px maximum in either dimension.

2. **Window not maximized**: The dialog window (`QDialog`) where the image is displayed is not set to fullscreen mode. In `ShowAnswer_PopUp.py`, the window uses some specific flags (`Qt.WindowType.FramelessWindowHint | Qt.WindowType.Popup | Qt.WindowType.NoDropShadowWindowHint`) but doesn't set it to fullscreen.

3. **No screen size detection**: The code doesn't detect the actual screen size to fill it appropriately.

To make the images display at full screen size, we would need to:

1. Remove the 1024px limitation and instead scale the image based on the actual screen dimensions
2. Set the popup window to be fullscreen
3. Possibly adjust how the image is positioned and scaled within the window

Would you like me to implement these changes to make your images display at full screen size?

_**User**_

dont code yet. this addon handle multiple lcd well. say my 23.8" and 19". how?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>
The user is asking about how the addon handles multiple monitors of different sizes (23.8" and 19"), and whether it properly scales across these different displays. Let me look for any code related to multi-monitor support or screen detection.

I need to check:
1. If the addon has any code to detect which monitor the Anki window is on
2. How it handles display size detection
3. If there's any specific multi-monitor handling code
</think>

Let me look for any code related to multi-monitor support or screen detection in the addon. I'll search for relevant functions that might handle display size detection:

Based on my analysis of the code, I understand how the addon handles multiple displays. Here's what I found:

The addon works with multiple monitors (like your 23.8" and 19" LCDs) because it creates the popup dialog with the Anki main window as its parent:

```python
window = QDialog(mw)
```

In Qt, when a dialog is created with a parent window (`mw` is the Anki main window), it inherits several behaviors from the parent:

1. **Screen inheritance**: The dialog appears on the same screen as its parent window
2. **Relative positioning**: It's typically positioned relative to the parent window
3. **Modal behavior**: It blocks input to the parent window when displayed modally with `exec()`

When using multiple monitors, the dialog automatically shows on whichever screen the Anki main window is currently displayed on. This works because:

1. The dialog is created with the Anki main window (`mw`) as its parent
2. Qt's windowing system automatically handles the correct screen placement
3. The popup is shown using `window.exec()` which creates a modal dialog on the same screen

The reason your images aren't displaying full screen is due to the fixed size limits in the code:

```python
max_height = min(pixmap.height(), 1024)
max_width = min(pixmap.width(), 1024)
picture = pixmap.scaled(max_width, max_height, Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio, Qt.TransformationMode.SmoothTransformation)
```

These lines are explicitly limiting the image size to a maximum of 1024x1024 pixels, regardless of your actual screen resolution. Additionally, the dialog itself isn't set to fullscreen mode - it just sizes itself to fit the content.

If you want to modify the addon to display your images at full screen size, we would need to:

1. Get the actual screen dimensions instead of using the fixed 1024px limit
2. Set the dialog to use fullscreen mode or explicitly size it to fill the screen
3. Scale the image appropriately to fit the screen while maintaining aspect ratio

Would you like me to implement these changes to make your images display at full screen size while maintaining the multi-monitor support?

---

_**User**_

dont code yet. tell me how you are going to implement.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>
Let me outline my implementation plan for making the images display at full screen size while maintaining multi-monitor support:

1. Screen Size Detection: 
   - Use Qt's QApplication.screens() to get information about all available screens
   - Use the screen where the parent window (mw) is located
   - Obtain the actual screen dimensions using screen.geometry() or screen.availableGeometry()

2. Modify Dialog Window:
   - Set the dialog to use a fullscreen or maximized window state
   - Or explicitly size it to the screen dimensions

3. Image Scaling:
   - Remove the fixed 1024px limitations
   - Scale the image based on the actual screen dimensions
   - Maintain aspect ratio when scaling the image

4. Implementation Locations:
   - Need to modify both Review_PopUp.py and ShowAnswer_PopUp.py
   - Similar changes in both files since they both create popup dialogs
</think>

# Implementation Plan for Full Screen Image Display

To make the images display at full screen size while maintaining multi-monitor support, I'll make the following changes:

## 1. Screen Size Detection
I'll add code to detect the actual screen dimensions where Anki is currently displayed:

```python
# Get the screen where the main window is displayed
screen = mw.window().screen()
# Get the available screen geometry (accounts for taskbars/docks)
screen_rect = screen.availableGeometry()
screen_width = screen_rect.width()
screen_height = screen_rect.height()
```

This uses Qt's built-in screen detection to get the correct monitor's dimensions, ensuring it works properly across multiple displays.

## 2. Dialog Window Modifications

I'll modify how the dialog window is created and configured:

```python
# Create dialog with parent set to main window (maintains multi-monitor behavior)
window = QDialog(mw)

# Set window to be frameless and treat as a popup
window.setWindowFlags(Qt.WindowType.FramelessWindowHint | Qt.WindowType.Popup | Qt.WindowType.NoDropShadowWindowHint)

# Set the size to match the screen dimensions
window.setFixedSize(screen_width, screen_height)

# Position it at the top-left of the available screen area
window.move(screen_rect.x(), screen_rect.y())
```

This will make the dialog fill the entire screen while maintaining the correct screen selection based on which monitor Anki is displayed on.

## 3. Image Scaling Changes

I'll replace the current fixed image scaling with dynamic screen-based scaling:

```python
# Load the image
pixmap = QPixmap(image_folder + image_name)

# Calculate scaling while maintaining aspect ratio
# Use screen dimensions instead of fixed 1024px values
picture = pixmap.scaled(screen_width, screen_height, 
                        Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio, 
                        Qt.TransformationMode.SmoothTransformation)

# Center the image in the available space
image.setAlignment(Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter)
image.setPixmap(picture)
```

## 4. Implementation Files

I'll need to modify both:
- `Review_PopUp.py` - for popups shown when answering cards
- `ShowAnswer_PopUp.py` - for popups shown when showing answers

The changes will be similar in both files since they both handle popup creation in nearly identical ways.

This implementation will keep all the existing behavior intact, including:
- Multi-monitor support (showing on the correct screen)
- Random selection of images
- Keyboard dismissal of popups
- All configuration options

The only change will be that images now fill the screen instead of being limited to 1024x1024 pixels.

Would you like me to implement these changes?

_**User**_

go code it pls.

_**Assistant**_

<think>
Now I'll implement the changes to make the images display at full screen size while maintaining multi-monitor support. I need to modify both the Review_PopUp.py and ShowAnswer_PopUp.py files.

Let's start with Review_PopUp.py.
</think>

I'll implement the changes to make the images display at full screen size. Let's start with modifying the Review_PopUp.py file:

---

```diff
      window = QDialog(mw)
      window.setWindowIcon(QIcon(join(addon_path, 'user_files/images') + "/icon.png"))
+     
+     # Get the screen where the main window is displayed
+     screen = mw.window().screen()
+     # Get the available screen geometry (accounts for taskbars/docks)
+     screen_rect = screen.availableGeometry()
+     screen_width = screen_rect.width()
+     screen_height = screen_rect.height()
+     
+     # Set window to be frameless
+     window.setWindowFlags(Qt.WindowType.FramelessWindowHint | Qt.WindowType.Popup | Qt.WindowType.NoDropShadowWindowHint)
+     
+     # Set the size to match the screen dimensions
+     window.setFixedSize(screen_width, screen_height)
+     
+     # Position it at the top-left of the available screen area
+     window.move(screen_rect.x(), screen_rect.y())
+     
      header = QLabel()
      header.setAlignment(Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter)
      header.setText("<div style='font-size: {}px; font-family: {};'> {} </div>".format(headerText_fontSize, headerText_fontStyle, header_text))
      image = QLabel()
      pixmap = QPixmap(image_folder + image_name)
-     max_height = min(pixmap.height(), 1024)
-     max_width = min(pixmap.width(), 1024)
-     picture = pixmap.scaled(max_width, max_height, Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio, Qt.TransformationMode.SmoothTransformation)
+     
+     # Use screen dimensions for scaling instead of fixed 1024px limits
+     picture = pixmap.scaled(screen_width, screen_height, Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio, Qt.TransformationMode.SmoothTransformation)
      image.setAlignment(Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter)
      image.setPixmap(picture)
+     
      layout = QVBoxLayout()
      if show_header:
      show_onEasy = config["Show on Easy"]
      window.setLayout(layout)
+     
+     # Add key press event to close on any key
+     window.keyPressEvent = lambda event: window.hide() if event.key() != Qt.Key.Key_unknown else None
+     
      if not show_image and not show_header:
          return
```

---

Now let's update the ShowAnswer_PopUp.py file in a similar way:

---

```diff
      window = QDialog(mw)
      window.setWindowIcon(QIcon(join(addon_path, 'user_files/images') + "/icon.png"))
+     
+     # Get the screen where the main window is displayed
+     screen = mw.window().screen()
+     # Get the available screen geometry (accounts for taskbars/docks)
+     screen_rect = screen.availableGeometry()
+     screen_width = screen_rect.width()
+     screen_height = screen_rect.height()
+     
+     # Set window to be frameless
+     window.setWindowFlags(Qt.WindowType.FramelessWindowHint | Qt.WindowType.Popup | Qt.WindowType.NoDropShadowWindowHint)
+     
+     # Set the size to match the screen dimensions
+     window.setFixedSize(screen_width, screen_height)
+     
+     # Position it at the top-left of the available screen area
+     window.move(screen_rect.x(), screen_rect.y())
+     
      header = QLabel()
      header.setAlignment(Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter)
      header.setText("<div style='font-size: {}px; font-family: {};'> {} </div>".format(headerText_fontSize, headerText_fontStyle, header_text))
      image = QLabel()
      pixmap = QPixmap(image_folder + image_name)
-     max_height = min(pixmap.height(), 1024)
-     max_width = min(pixmap.width(), 1024)
-     picture = pixmap.scaled(max_width, max_height, Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio, Qt.TransformationMode.SmoothTransformation)
+     
+     # Use screen dimensions for scaling instead of fixed 1024px limits
+     picture = pixmap.scaled(screen_width, screen_height, Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio, Qt.TransformationMode.SmoothTransformation)
      image.setAlignment(Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter)
      image.setPixmap(picture)
      image.setAlignment(Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter)
+     
      layout = QVBoxLayout()
      if show_header:
          layout.addWidget(image)
      window.setLayout(layout)
-     window.setWindowFlags(Qt.WindowType.FramelessWindowHint | Qt.WindowType.Popup | Qt.WindowType.NoDropShadowWindowHint)
+     
+     # Key press event is already set below, but keeping the window flags consistent
      window.keyPressEvent = lambda event: window.hide() if event.key() != Qt.Key.Key_unknown else None
+     
      if not show_image and not show_header:
          return
```

---

The modifications are now complete! Here's a summary of the changes I've made:

1. **Screen Size Detection**: Added code to both files to detect the current screen dimensions using Qt's built-in screen detection
   ```python
   screen = mw.window().screen()
   screen_rect = screen.availableGeometry()
   screen_width = screen_rect.width()
   screen_height = screen_rect.height()
   ```

2. **Full Screen Window**: Set the popup dialog to be full screen by:
   - Making it frameless with appropriate window flags
   - Setting its size to match the screen dimensions
   - Positioning it at the top-left of the available screen area
   ```python
   window.setFixedSize(screen_width, screen_height)
   window.move(screen_rect.x(), screen_rect.y())
   ```

3. **Dynamic Image Scaling**: Replaced the fixed 1024px image size limitation with dynamic scaling based on the screen dimensions
   ```python
   # Replaced this:
   # max_height = min(pixmap.height(), 1024)
   # max_width = min(pixmap.width(), 1024)
   # picture = pixmap.scaled(max_width, max_height, ...)
   
   # With this:
   picture = pixmap.scaled(screen_width, screen_height, Qt.AspectRatioMode.KeepAspectRatio, Qt.TransformationMode.SmoothTransformation)
   ```

4. **User Interaction**: Maintained the behavior of closing the popup on key press in both files

These changes preserve all the existing functionality of the addon while making the images display at full screen size. The addon will continue to work correctly with multiple monitors, showing the popup on whichever screen Anki is currently displayed on.

The images will now scale to fill as much of the screen as possible while maintaining their aspect ratio, so your wallpaper-sized images will display properly at full screen size.

Would you like to make any additional adjustments to these changes?

git complain. tellme why? it say this repo is unsafe.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>
The error message about the repo being unsafe likely comes from Git's security mechanisms. When Git identifies a potential security risk in a repository, it may issue warnings about the repository being "unsafe." Let me analyze what might be causing this.

Common reasons a Git repo might be flagged as unsafe:

1. File paths with special characters or unusual encoding
2. Symbolic links pointing outside the repository
3. File permissions issues
4. Files with non-standard line endings
5. Hidden or suspicious files that could indicate malware

Looking at the repository structure we've seen, I don't immediately see anything suspicious, but there are a few things that might trigger Git's security warnings:

1. The repo path has a lot of single letters separated by slashes: `/o%3A/0-i/j-r/r/repos/a-i/a/anki/addons/a-i/a/Anki-Review-PopUp`
   - The `%3A` suggests URL encoding, which Git might find suspicious
   - The many single letter directories like `a-i/a/` could be flagged

2. The path structure is quite deep and unusual, which can sometimes trigger security warnings

3. There might be symbolic links or other file system objects not visible in our directory listings

Let's try to address the Git complaint by suggesting some troubleshooting steps and fixes.
</think>

The Git complaint about the repository being "unsafe" is likely due to the unusual path structure in your workspace. I notice your repository path contains URL-encoded characters and multiple short directory names:

```
/o%3A/0-i/j-r/r/repos/a-i/a/anki/addons/a-i/a/Anki-Review-PopUp
```

There are several reasons Git might flag a repository as unsafe:

1. **URL-encoded characters**: The `%3A` in your path (which is the encoded form of a colon `:`) might be triggering Git's security measures.

2. **Deeply nested paths with unusual structure**: Your path has many single-letter directories (`a-i/a/`) and an unusual structure that Git might find suspicious.

3. **Cross-directory references**: If your repository contains symbolic links that point outside the repository boundary, Git may flag this as unsafe.

4. **Line ending issues**: Different line ending styles between Windows and Unix systems can sometimes cause Git to flag files.

To resolve this issue, you can try:

1. **Configure Git to trust this directory**:
   ```
   git config --global --add safe.directory /o%3A/0-i/j-r/r/repos/a-i/a/anki/addons/a-i/a/Anki-Review-PopUp
   ```

2. **Check for symbolic links** that might be causing issues:
   ```
   find . -type l
   ```

3. **Normalize line endings** by setting Git's core.autocrlf property:
   ```
   git config --global core.autocrlf true
   ```

4. **Create a fresh clone** of the repository in a simpler path structure if possible

Would you like me to help you implement any of these solutions to fix the Git safety warnings?

show me git's origin, any upstream?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>
The user wants me to check the Git origin and any upstream repositories for this project. I need to use the terminal to run git commands to view remote repository information.
</think>

Let me check the Git remote configuration to see the origin and any upstream repositories:

---

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
PS O:\0-i\j-r\r\repos\a-i\a\anki\addons\a-i\a\Anki-Review-PopUp> git remote -v
PS O:\0-i\j-r\r\repos\a-i\a\anki\addons\a-i\a\Anki-Review-PopUp> git remote -v


























origin  https://github.com/ccchan234/Anki-Review-PopUp.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/ccchan234/Anki-Review-PopUp.git (push) 
PS O:\0-i\j-r\r\repos\a-i\a\anki\addons\a-i\a\Anki-Review-PopUp>
```

Let's also check if there are any upstream branches configured:
